# TagTex
Creating custom nametags, badges. Planning to use Python + LaTeX only.

Example usage:
```shell
python main.py -c ../wca-competition-orga/GermanNationals2023-registration -id GermanNationals2023 > output.txt
```
This output can be placed in the template document and will serve as the content to be formatted into printable nametags.
